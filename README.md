## Context

Tic tac toe, is a project that required the understanding and use of classes to create a fully functional game using the cosole. This was challenging but helped me to deepened my knowledge in Object Oriented Programming. This application is the last project of the first Module of Turing School of Software and Design.

With no comps provided by the instructors, I created a `project bord` to organize, plan and keep track of the project's evolution. It was very helpful to make use the `milestones` and `issues` to make sure I was working to finish each iteration and have a clear vision of where I wanted to be at the end of the day. This has been mianly one of my biggest areas of improvement that I am making sure to practice daily.

The goal of this project was to create a tic-tac-toe game between `player1` and `player 2`.

#### Technologies used:
    * HTML
    * CSS
    * JavaScript
    * Terminal
    * GitHub
    * Google's developer tools

## Challenges

    * Atomic commits (capitalizing the first letter)
    * Better PR implementation
    * Connectiong the DOM with classes


## Wins
- Being able to work through the logic of the game
- Set up the mocha and chai libraries to implement unit testing
- Finish the overall HTML and CSS structure
- Responsive design
- Having a functional game using the console
- Using the project board *milestones, issues, labels and tickets* to keep track of my progress
- Use of the GitHub milestones and issues to structure my project

## Future Goals

  * Add multiplayer functionality
  * Add a form to fill out to begin to pick a player's name
  * Add the computer as an option to play against
  * Add levels of difficulty 

## In Action

  #### Take 1

* When the player places a token on the board it cannot longer place the same token on another cell. On the header it also signals which player is next, allowing this way a visual representation of the game flow.

There are only two tokens that can have been placed on the game board a white chicken facing left and a purpled pixeled alien from a video game" height=auto width=75%/>

 #### Take 2

*  When a winner is found the header displays who the winner was by changing the text of the header to indicate the winner. The player's win count also increment depending on which player won the game

  #### Take 3

* Saving player winning boards to the player's section. After a winner is declared the board that the winner just wons is saved and moved to the players section. These boards are also saved to local storage so they can be retrieved after the page reloads.

 #### Take 4

* During the game if a wiinner is not found a message is vissible indicating the status of the game, and in this case it displays the message 'It is a draw.'

 #### Take 5
* After completing the functionality of the game the next iteration I worked on was the `CSS` responsiveness. Here we can appreciate how the application behave at different screen sizes.
